# 🍷 Vinolin AI Prototypes Suite

> A Next.js 14 Full-Stack showcase demonstrating RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and Computer Vision capabilities tailored for the Digital Wine Industry.

**Live Demo:** https://vinolin-ai-prototypes.vercel.app

## Project Overview
I built this application to demonstrate how Vinolin can leverage Generative AI to solve two specific B2B challenges:
1.  **Trustworthy Consultation:** A chatbot that strictly adheres to a partner's inventory (no hallucinations).
2.  **Inventory Digitization:** Converting physical bottle labels into structured database entries.

## Key Modules

### 1. The Digital Cellar (B2B RAG Agent)
A conversational interface designed for winery websites.
*   **Feature:** Simulates a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.
*   **Guardrails:** The AI is instructed to only recommend wines from a specific "Partner Catalog," strictly rejecting off-topic queries or hallucinated products.
*   **Tech:** Next.js App Router, React Server Components, Streaming UI.

### 2. LabelLens (Multimodal Inventory Tool)
A mobile-first computer vision utility.
*   **Feature:** Mimics the scanning of a wine bottle to extract metadata (Vintage, Region, Grape).
*   **Output:** Returns structured JSON data validated via Zod schemas, ready for database insertion.
*   **Tech:** Server Actions, Computer Vision Simulation.

## Technical Decisions

### Why "Demo Mode"?
To ensure a zero-latency, 100% reliable experience for the review team, this specific deployment utilizes Mocked Streaming Responses in the backend.

Instead of relying on live external API keys (which can rate-limit or fail regionally), I engineered the backend to simulate the exact behavior of an LLM (latency, token streaming, structured output) using native JavaScript Web Streams and setTimeout simulation.

This ensures the application works immediately after cloning, with no environment variables required.

## Dependencies & Stack
This project was initialized with create-next-app and uses the following core libraries:

*   **Framework:** next (v14+ App Router)
*   **Styling:** tailwindcss, clsx, tailwind-merge
*   **Icons:** lucide-react
*   **AI Simulation:** ai (Vercel AI SDK patterns)
*   **Validation:** zod
